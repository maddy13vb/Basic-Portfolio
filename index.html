                <p> My name is Madelyn McKenzie Young and I was born on 9/11/95. I have a rescue dog named Karma and a
                    bunny named Lucy.
                    I currently work at two sushi restaurant and previously was a dental assistant. Neither of those
                    jobs are for me, so I decided to give coding a try.
                    I love to travel! One day I hope to visit every country so that I can experience different cultures
                    as well as see beautiful places.
                    I enjoy painting, playing volleyball, and listening to music in my free time. Some of my favorite
                    bands include Foo Fighters, The Doors, Led Zeppelin, and Nirvana. Overall, I like to try new things and have fun!
